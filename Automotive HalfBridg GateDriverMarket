The half-bridge defines a scheme with two switches connected in series across the power supply, so that the supplied power to the load, generally an electric motor, can be controlled. The use of half-bridge gate drivers is to provide switching in both power MOSFETs and IGBTs incorporated into a half-bridge configuration. The gate driver supplies the voltage and current needed to turn-on and -off the switches for efficient operation and to minimize loss of power.

These drivers are pivotal for application in electric and hybrid vehicle drives, whereby they are applied to control electric motors for propulsion and regenerative braking. The ability for the power devices to switch fast is critical to improvement of system performance in general, reduction of heat generation, and enhancement of energy efficiency.
